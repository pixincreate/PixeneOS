> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. This project is not affiliated with GrapheneOS or any of the mentioned projects. It is a personal project for personal use.
> 2. Currently, the project only supports Linux due to compatibility issues with other operating systems (`libsepol` is highly Linux-specific).

## Requirements

To use this project, you need the following (most dependencies will be handled by the script, except for `git` and `python`):

- A Linux machine is recommended (Needed for running a statically-linked Android executable). `WSL` (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a `VM` (Virtual Machine) can also be used instead
- Tools (must be in the path):
  - `afsr` (>= version 1.0.2)
  - `avbroot` (>= version 3.12.0)
  - `my_avbroot_setup` (>= commit `16636c`)
  - `custota-tool` (>= version 5.2)
  - `git`
  - `Magisk` (>= version 27006 -- optional)
  - `python`
- Modules:
  - `AlterInstaller` (>= version 2.0)
  - `BCR` (>= version 1.65)
  - `Charge Limit`
  - `Custota` (>= version 5.2)
  - `MSD` (>= version 1.8)
  - `OEMUnlockOnBoot` (>= version 1.1)
- Dependencies:
  - `e2fsprogs`
  - `pkg-config`
  - `tomlkit` (Python dependency)
  - `pydantic` (Python dependency)

## Working

This repository acts as a server.

1. [Release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) checks if a build already exists. If only the `rootless` flavor exists and the user opts for the `magisk` flavor, it builds it, and vice versa. If both flavors exist for a specific version and device, it skips the build.
2. The workflow calls the build script, which downloads all the [requirements](#requirements) and patches the OTA by adding your signing key and installing the additional packages mentioned in the [features section](#features).
3. The patched OTA is released and available in the [releases section](https://github.com/pixincreate/PixeneOS/releases).
4. The server branch is updated based on the selected flavor (`rootless` is the default).

## Usage

### Getting Started

Reading the [AVBRoot docs](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/AVBRoot) is essential before proceeding with PixeneOS.

1. Ensure the device has an unpatched version of GrapheneOS installed. The version must match the one from PixeneOS. It is important to make sure that the version installed matches the version on PixeneOS
2. Start with a version before the latest to ensure OTA functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `Factory image` and `OTA image` are different. AVBRoot is meant to deal with **OTA images**. So does PixeneOS.

### Detailed Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In case you run into an issue that throws `Device is corrupt. It can't be trusted` soon after first install, try sideloading the OTA once before proceeding with flashing the custom AVB public key. This suggestion is based on the experience of users who faced this issue. See [#89](https://github.com/schnatterer/rooted-graphene/issues/89).
> Also, check the FAQ section for more information on [this](https://github.com/pixincreate/PixeneOS/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md#im-getting-an-error-on-boot-saying-device-is-corrupt-it-cant-be-trusted-what-can-i-do-what-are-my-options) issue.

> [!CAUTION]
> If flashing fails, [**do not switch the slot**](https://github.com/schnatterer/rooted-graphene/issues/96#issuecomment-3128121844).

#### Web Install

It is easier to use the web installer to flash GrapheneOS. However, it is recommended to use the manual method since it makes it possible to install an older version of GrapheneOS unlike the web installer which always installs the latest version.

- Use the [web installer](https://grapheneos.org/install/web) to install GrapheneOS
- Once installed, **do not** re-lock the bootloader by clicking `Lock bootloader` under the `Locking the bootloader` section
- Proceed to the [patching section](#patching-grapheneos-cooking-pixeneos)

#### Manual Install

1. Ensure Fastboot version is `34` or newer. `35` or above is recommended as older versions are known to have bugs that prevent commands like `fastboot flashall` from running.

   ```shell
   fastboot --version
   ```

2. Reboot into `fastboot` mode and unlock the bootloader if not already. **This will trigger a data wipe.** Ensure data is backed up.

   ```shell
   fastboot flashing unlock
   ```

3. When setting PixeneOS up for the first time, the device must already be running the correct OS. Flash the original unpatched OTA or factory image if needed.

   ```shell
   bsdtar xvf DEVICE_NAME-factory-VERSION.zip # tar on Windows and macOS
   ./flash-all.sh # or .bat on Windows
   ```

4. Proceed to the [patching section](#patching-grapheneos-cooking-pixeneos)

#### Patching GrapheneOS (cooking PixeneOS)

1. Download the [OTA from the releases](https://github.com/pixincreate/PixeneOS/releases). Ensure the version matches the installed version.

   Extract the partition images from the patched OTA that are different from the original.

   ```shell
   avbroot ota extract \
       --input /path/to/ota.zip.patched \
       --directory extracted \
       --fastboot
   ```

   To extract and flash all OS partitions, pass `--all`.

2. Set the `ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT` environment variable to the directory containing the extracted files.

   For `sh`/`bash`/`zsh` (Linux, macOS, WSL):

   ```shell
   export ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT=extracted
   ```

   For PowerShell (Windows):

   ```powershell
   $env:ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT = "extracted"
   ```

   For cmd (Windows):

   ```bat
   set ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT=extracted
   ```

3. Flash the partition images.

   ```shell
   fastboot flashall --skip-reboot
   ```

   Note: This only flashes the OS partitions. The bootloader and modem/radio partitions are left untouched due to fastboot limitations. If they are not already up to date or if unsure, after fastboot completes, follow the steps in the [updates section](#updates) to sideload the patched OTA once. Sideloading OTAs always ensures that all partitions are up to date.

   Alternatively, for Pixel devices, running `flash-base.sh` from the factory image will also update the bootloader and modem.

4. Set up the custom AVB public key in the bootloader after rebooting from fastbootd to bootloader.

   ```shell
   fastboot reboot-bootloader
   fastboot erase avb_custom_key
   fastboot flash avb_custom_key /path/to/avb_pkmd.bin
   ```

5. **[Optional]** Before locking the bootloader, reboot into Android to confirm proper signing.

   Install the Magisk or KernelSU app and run:

   ```shell
   adb shell su -c 'dmesg | grep libfs_avb'
   ```

   If AVB is working, you should see:

   ```shell
   init: [libfs_avb]Returning avb_handle with status: Success
   ```

6. Reboot into fastboot and lock the bootloader. This will trigger a data wipe.

   ```shell
   fastboot flashing lock
   ```

   Confirm by pressing volume down and then power. Then reboot.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Do not uncheck `OEM unlocking`!**

7. For future updates, see the [updates section](#updates).

### Using Root

Rooting, from security point of view is **not** recommended. But that should not stop a power user from using it.

The version of [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) provided by Topjohnwu does not hold good with GrapheneOS as the developers of Magisk are hostile with GrapheneOS developers and its users. See [7606](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/pull/7606).

The fork of [Magisk](https://github.com/pixincreate/Magisk) that is maintained by @pixincreate does overcome of the limitations by making root access work on GrapheneOS while allowing Zygisk to work. It of course with its own limitations set up by developers who develop root hiding solutions which [prevents](https://github.com/pixincreate/Magisk/issues/1) the fork from supporting modules like Shamiko.

In general, using [Magisk and especially the features like Zygisk with Graphene are likely to have the risk of breaking things with every new release in future.](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot/issues/213#issuecomment-1986637884).

Using the [fork of Magisk that supports Zygisk](https://github.com/pixincreate/Magisk) is recommended over official Magisk and KernelSU as the official Magisk is completely broken on GrapheneOS including `Zygisk` while getting KernelSU working on GrapheneOS is itself a tedious task as GrapheneOS enforces signature verification on Kernel and hence, building GrapheneOS with KernelSU from scratch is the only option if root is need.

KernelSU does have some parts like `ksud`'s sources closed which makes it inappropriate for a tool that has so much influence on the device.

> [!NOTE]
> For Magisk preinit, see [Magisk preinit](#magisk-preinit)

### Magisk Preinit

Magisk versions 25211 and newer require a writable partition for storing custom SELinux rules that need to be accessed during early boot stages. This can only be determined on a real device, so avbroot requires the partition to be explicitly specified via `--magisk-preinit-device <name>`. To find the partition name:

1. Extract the boot image from the original/unpatched OTA:

   ```shell
   avbroot ota extract \
       --input /path/to/ota.zip \
       --directory . \
       --boot-only
   ```

2. Patch the boot image via the Magisk app on the target device.

   The Magisk app will print out a line like:

   ```shell
   Pre-init storage partition device ID: <name>
   ```

   Alternatively, run:

   ```shell
   avbroot boot magisk-info \
       --image magisk_patched-*.img
   ```

   The partition name will be shown as `PREINITDEVICE=<name>`.

   Now that the partition name is known, it can be passed to avbroot when patching via `--magisk-preinit-device <name>`. The partition name should be saved somewhere for future reference since it's unlikely to change across Magisk updates.

   If the device is unbootable, patch and flash the OTA once using `--ignore-magisk-warnings`, then repatch and reflash the OTA with `--magisk-preinit-device <name>`.

### Updates

Updates can be done by patching (or re-patching) the OTA using `adb sideload`:

1. Reboot to recovery mode. If stuck at `No command`, press Volume up while holding Power button.
2. Sideload the patched OTA with `adb sideload` by using volume buttons to toggle to `Apply update from ADB` which can be confirmed by pressing the power button

PixeneOS leverages Custota:

1. Disable the [system updater app](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot#ota-updates).
2. Open Custota and set the OTA server URL to: `https://pixincreate.github.io/PixeneOS/<rootless/magisk>`

For more info, refer to the [server](https://github.com/pixincreate/PixeneOS/tree/gh-pages) branch.

## Tool Usage

PixeneOS can be run on your local machine. A Linux based machine is preferred.

1. Clone or fork the repository

2. Modify `env.toml` to set environment variables (your device model, AVBRoot architecture, GrapheneOS update channel and etc.,)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that `env.toml` file exist in root of the project.

3. Run the program end-to-end:

   ```shell
   . src/main.sh
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Running the program end-to-end will only generate the patched OTA package locally and will not push it to the server (server branch that contains the json file which is read by the Custota).

`INTERACTIVE_MODE`, by default is set to `true` that calls `check_toml_env` function to check the existence of `env.toml`. If the file exist, it will read the `env.toml` file and set the environment variables accordingly. If the `env.toml` is non-existent, ignored. If it exist, and the format is wrong, the script exits with an error.

To make the patched OTA available to the device, it needs to be hosted on the server. PixeneOS uses GitHub for pushing updates, handled by [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml).

To set up automated release, add the following variables in GitHub secrets:

- `EMAIL`: Email address associated with the GitHub account.
- Base64 encoded keys:
  - `AVB_KEY`
  - `CERT_OTA`
  - `OTA_KEY`
- Passphrases used to generate the keys:
  - `PASSPHRASE_AVB`
  - `PASSPHRASE_OTA`

### Hop Between Root and Rootless

- To remove root, set the following URL in Custota: `https://pixincreate.github.io/PixeneOS/rootless/`
- To add root, set the following URL in Custota: `https://pixincreate.github.io/PixeneOS/magisk/`

### Commands

- To see the list of available commands:

  ```shell
  . src/util_functions.sh && help
  ```

  `help` command will display the help message.

- To see the list of supported tools:

  ```shell
  . src/util_functions.sh && supported_tools
  ```

  `supported_tools` command will display the list of tools that are supported.

- To generate AVB keys:

  ```shell
  . src/util_functions.sh && generate_keys
  ```

  This command will generate the AVB keys and store them in `.keys` directory.

> [!WARNING]
> For security reasons, `.keys` directory will **not** be pushed to your GitHub repository.> Execute `setup_hooks.sh` to install a pre-commit hook that will prevent `.keys` directory from being pushed.

- To create and make the release:

  ```shell
  . src/util_functions.sh && create_and_make_release
  ```

- To call individual functions/commands:

  ```shell
  . src/<file>.sh && <function_name>
  ```

## Reverting Back to Stock

To revert to stock GrapheneOS or firmware:

1. Reboot into fastboot mode and unlock the bootloader. **This will trigger a data wipe**. Ensure data is backed up.

2. Erase the custom AVB public key:

   ```shell
   fastboot erase avb_custom_key
   ```

3. Flash the stock firmware.
